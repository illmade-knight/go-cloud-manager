# **Requirements Planner: Declarative Cloud Orchestration System**

This document outlines the structure for generating the full requirements for a declarative, multi-service cloud orchestration and deployment system. We will use a layered approach to separate business goals from architectural rules and technical specifications.

## **L1: Business & Functional Requirements (The "What")**

*What problem does this system solve from a user's perspective? What are the core capabilities it must offer?*

### **1\. Core Mission**

* **1.1. Declarative Architecture Definition:** Users must be able to define an entire microservice architecture—including applications and their infrastructure dependencies—in one or more human-readable configuration files (e.g., YAML).
* **1.2. Automated Lifecycle Management:** The system must provide automated workflows to provision (setup), verify, and decommission (teardown) the complete architecture defined in the configuration.
* **1.3. Service Deployment:** The system must be able to build container images from source code and deploy them as running services on a target cloud platform.

### **2\. Key Features**

* **2.1. Infrastructure Provisioning:** The system must manage the lifecycle of core cloud infrastructure resources.
* **2.2. Identity and Access Management (IAM):** The system must automatically configure all necessary permissions for services to operate and communicate securely.
* **2.3. Application Build & Deploy:** The system must automate the process of turning source code into a running application.
* **2.4. Environment Management:** The system must support the concept of distinct environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with differing configurations and lifecycle policies.
* **2.5. Pre-flight & Validation:** The system must perform checks to validate configuration and ensure the target cloud environment is ready for deployment.

### **3\. Areas for Improvement & Future Capabilities (L1)**

* **3.1. Drift Detection:** The system should provide a mechanism to detect and report on differences between the desired state (in configuration) and the actual state (in the cloud).
* **3.2. Cost Estimation:** The system could provide a pre-deployment cost estimate based on the defined resources.
* **3.3. Enhanced Teardown:** The system should support more granular teardown options, such as targeting a single service or resource.

## **L2: Architectural & Non-Functional Requirements (The "How")**

*What are the fundamental rules, qualities, and constraints that govern the system's design?*

### **1\. Core Architecture Principles**

* **1.1. Modularity & Separation of Concerns:** The system's core domains—resource management, IAM, and deployment—must be implemented as distinct, loosely-coupled modules.
* **1.2. Provider Abstraction:** The core logic must be decoupled from any specific cloud provider's implementation through a well-defined adapter or provider interface.
* **1.3. Idempotency:** All provisioning and deployment operations must be idempotent. Running an operation multiple times should result in the same state as running it once.
* **1.4. Concurrency:** The system must perform independent operations concurrently to maximize efficiency.

### **2\. Reliability & Safety**

* **2.1. Lifecycle Protection:** The system must distinguish between permanent and ephemeral resources, protecting permanent resources from accidental deletion.
* **2.2. Atomic Operations:** Where possible, operations affecting a single resource's state (e.g., setting an IAM policy) should be atomic.
* **2.3. Resiliency:** The system must be resilient to the eventual consistency of cloud APIs, implementing appropriate retries and polling for verification.

### **3\. Testability**

* **3.1. Unit Testability:** All core logic modules must be unit-testable in isolation using mocks or stubs.
* **3.2. Integration Testability:** The system must be testable against local emulators and real cloud environments.

### **4\. Areas for Improvement & Future Capabilities (L2)**

* **4.1. State Management:** The system must use a robust, remote, and lockable state backend to manage the state of provisioned resources, preventing conflicts in team environments.
* **4.2. Extensibility:** Define a clear plugin architecture for adding support for new resource types or cloud providers.
* **4.3. Transactional Operations:** For complex, multi-step operations, the system should support a mechanism for rollback on failure.

## **L3: Technical & Configuration Requirements (The "Specifics")**

*What are the specific resources, configuration parameters, and technical details that must be implemented?*

### **1\. Configuration Schema (systemarchitecture.go)**

* **1.1. Root Document:** Define the structure for the root architecture file, including environment defaults and dataflow groupings.
* **1.2. Service Specification:** Define all required and optional fields for a service definition (e.g., name, service\_account, deployment\_spec).
* **1.3. Resource Specifications:** Define the configuration schema for every supported cloud resource.
    * **1.3.1. Pub/Sub Topic:** Must support name, labels, producer\_service.
    * **1.3.2. GCS Bucket:** Must support name, location, storage\_class, versioning\_enabled.
    * *(...and so on for every other resource)*
* **1.4. IAM Policy Specification:** Define the schema for embedding IAM policies within resource definitions.

### **2\. Supported Cloud Services (Initial Scope: GCP)**

* **2.1. Compute:** Google Cloud Run.
* **2.2. Storage:** Google Cloud Storage.
* **2.3. Messaging:** Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
* **2.4. Database:** Google Cloud Firestore, Google BigQuery.
* **2.5. Scheduling:** Google Cloud Scheduler.
* **2.6. Build:** Google Cloud Build, Google Artifact Registry.
* **2.7. Security:** Google IAM, Google Secret Manager.

### **3\. Areas for Improvement & Future Capabilities (L3)**

* **3.1. New Resource Support:** Add support for Cloud SQL, Memorystore, etc.
* **3.2. Alternative Deployment Targets:** Add support for deploying to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
* **3.3. Configuration Language:** Evaluate supporting HCL (Terraform's language) as an alternative or replacement for YAML to enable more complex logic.
