## requirements as code

we are looking to create code efficiently from requirements using LLMs

first we want to conduct an exercise - 

we have an existing github repo of Infrastructure as code 

we want to work backwards initially - 

generating the requirements from the existing code.

We then want to create prompts from the requirements that will create the end code

so for the exercise I will start uploading files for analysis - confirm reception of the
files and conduct a brief analysis. 
DO NOT DO ANYTHING MORE until I ask you create layered requirements documents.

Remember the end goal is to create WORKING code from the requirements so the requirements must COVER the code I show you.

## Review

When we have our requirements docs we will review and ensure we have what we meed before proceeding to the prompt generation stage:

I find LLMs work best when presented with a clear outline of *the overall* aims, local requirements and staged progress.

We should have a guiding prompt for each section and detailed sub-prompts. 
Each sub-prompt section should be self contained - or at least we should try and minimise dependence from one prompt group 
on another.

## Feedback

Please give feedback often and early - we prefer to clean problems up in advance rather than make
rapid progress in the wrong directions.

Does this plan make sense to you?
