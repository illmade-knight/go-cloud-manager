# **Prompt 29: Implementation for Scheduler Adapter**

**Objective:** Generate the complete implementation for the googlescheduler.go adapter. The generated code must satisfy the previously defined integration tests.

**TDD Phase:** Green (Write the code to make the failing tests pass).

## **Primary Prompt (Concise)**

Your task is to generate the Go code for the servicemanager/googlescheduler.go file.

I have provided the SchedulerClient interface that the adapter must implement, and a complete integration test file (googlescheduler\_integration\_test.go). Your implementation of the Scheduler adapter **must** make all the tests in the provided test file pass.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Full Implementation:** The adapter must correctly implement all methods on the SchedulerClient interface using the cloud.google.com/go/scheduler/apiv1 SDK.
* **Target Configuration:** The CreateJob method must correctly configure a job to target a Pub/Sub topic, including setting the topic name, message body, and any necessary authentication details.
* **Pass All Tests:** The generated code must successfully pass the lifecycle test (Create, Delete) defined in the integration test file.

## **Reinforcement Prompt (Detailed Context)**

**Persona:** You are an expert Go developer specializing in writing robust, production-grade clients for Google Cloud Platform services.

**Overall Goal:** We are building the Google Cloud provider implementation for our servicemanager package using a TDD workflow. We have already written the integration tests that define the required behavior of our Cloud Scheduler adapter. Your task is now to write the implementation code that satisfies those tests.

**Your Specific Task:** Your task is to generate the complete code for a single Go file: **servicemanager/googlescheduler.go**. This file will contain the concrete gcpSchedulerClientAdapter struct and its methods, which implement the SchedulerClient interface.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Pass All Tests:** This is the most critical requirement. Your generated code must correctly implement all the logic necessary to make the tests in the provided googlescheduler\_integration\_test.go file pass.
* **Adapter Pattern:** You must create the adapter structs that wrap the real Google Cloud SDK types (\*scheduler.CloudSchedulerClient) to satisfy our generic interfaces.
* **Pub/Sub Target:** The CreateJob implementation must correctly construct a schedulerpb.Job with a PubsubTarget. It needs to translate the topic name from our generic configuration into the fully qualified topic name required by the API (e.g., projects/your-project/topics/your-topic).
* **Validation Logic:** The Validate method must correctly parse and validate cron strings and timezones as specified in the tests.

### **Implementation Guidelines & Constraints**

* **Use Modern, Idiomatic GCP Libraries:** You **must** use the most recent, idiomatic cloud.google.com/go/scheduler/apiv1 library and its corresponding schedulerpb types.
* **Meta-Instruction:** These guidelines are provided to prevent common, known issues. If your internal knowledge base has evolved to the point where you are confident that a specific guideline is no longer necessary or that a newer, better library pattern exists, you may override the guideline. If you do so, you **must** leave a code comment explaining your reasoning.

**Dependencies (Full source code to be provided):**

1. **The Contract:** servicemanager/scheduleradapter.go (contains the SchedulerClient interface that the adapter must implement)
2. **The Specification:** servicemanager/googlescheduler\_integration\_test.go (the integration tests your code must pass)

Output Instructions:  
Generate the complete, well-commented Go code for the googlescheduler.go file.

* The package name must be servicemanager.
* Include a factory function CreateGoogleSchedulerClient that initializes the real \*scheduler.CloudSchedulerClient and returns it wrapped in our generic SchedulerClient interface.
* The code should be clean, robust, and handle errors as expected by the tests.
