# **Prompt 13: Implementation for MessagingManager**

**Objective:** Generate the complete implementation for the MessagingManager. The generated code must satisfy the previously defined unit tests.

**TDD Phase:** Green (Write the code to make the failing tests pass).

## **Primary Prompt (Concise)**

Your task is to generate the Go code for the servicemanager/messagingmanager.go file.

I have provided the MessagingClient interface that the manager must use, and a complete unit test file (messagingmanager\_test.go). Your implementation of the MessagingManager **must** make all the tests in the provided test file pass.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Dependency Handling:** The CreateResources method must create topics first, then subscriptions, ensuring it verifies a topic exists before creating a subscription attached to it.
* **Idempotency (L2-1.3):** The CreateResources method must handle both the creation of new resources and the update of existing ones.
* **Concurrency (L2-1.4):** The implementation must process multiple topics and subscriptions in parallel using goroutines.
* **Teardown Order:** The Teardown method must delete subscriptions before deleting topics to respect dependencies.

## **Reinforcement Prompt (Detailed Context)**

**Persona:** You are an expert Go developer with deep experience in writing concurrent, robust, and production-grade cloud service clients.

**Overall Goal:** We are building the servicemanager package using a Test-Driven Development approach. We have already written the unit tests that define the required behavior of the MessagingManager. Your task is now to write the implementation code that satisfies those tests.

**Your Specific Task:** Your task is to generate the complete code for a single Go file: **servicemanager/messagingmanager.go**. This file will contain the MessagingManager struct and its methods. The logic you write must be correct according to the provided test specification.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Pass All Tests:** This is the most critical requirement. Your generated code must correctly implement all the logic necessary to make the tests in the provided messagingmanager\_test.go file pass. This includes:
    * **Two-Phase Creation:** The CreateResources method must be implemented in two distinct, sequential phases: first, create all topics concurrently; second, create all subscriptions concurrently.
    * **Dependency Check:** Before attempting to create a subscription, you **must** use the client to verify that its parent topic exists.
    * **Idempotent Creation:** For both topics and subscriptions, you must first check if the resource exists. If it does, call Update. If it does not, call Create.
    * **Correct Teardown Order:** The Teardown method must also be two-phased: first, delete all subscriptions concurrently; second, delete all topics concurrently.
    * **Concurrency:** Use a sync.WaitGroup and goroutines for all parallel operations, ensuring you safely collect any errors from the goroutines.

**Dependencies (Full source code to be provided):**

1. **The Contract:** servicemanager/messagingadapter.go (contains the MessagingClient interface that the manager must use)
2. **The Specification:** servicemanager/messagingmanager\_test.go (the unit tests your code must pass)
3. **The Schema:** servicemanager/systemarchitecture.go (contains the TopicConfig and SubscriptionConfig structs)

Output Instructions:  
Generate the complete, well-commented Go code for the messagingmanager.go file.

* The package name must be servicemanager.
* The MessagingManager struct should hold a MessagingClient, a logger, and an environment config.
* The implementation must be thread-safe.
* Provide clear logging for each major operation (e.g., "Processing topics...", "Processing subscriptions...").
