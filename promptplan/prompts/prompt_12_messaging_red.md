# **Prompt 11: Implementation for StorageManager**

**Objective:** Generate the complete implementation for the StorageManager. The generated code must satisfy the previously defined unit tests.

**TDD Phase:** Green (Write the code to make the failing tests pass).

## **Primary Prompt (Concise)**

Your task is to generate the Go code for the servicemanager/storagemanager.go file.

I have provided the StorageClient interface that the manager must use, and a complete unit test file (storagemanager\_test.go). Your implementation of the StorageManager **must** make all the tests in the provided test file pass.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **L1-2.1 (Infrastructure Provisioning):** Implement the CreateResources, Verify, and Teardown methods.
* **L2-1.3 (Idempotency):** The CreateResources method must handle both creation and updates.
* **L2-1.4 (Concurrency):** The implementation must process multiple resources in parallel using goroutines.
* **L2-2.1 (Lifecycle Protection):** The Teardown method must respect the teardown\_protection flag.

## **Reinforcement Prompt (Detailed Context)**

**Persona:** You are an expert Go developer with deep experience in writing concurrent, robust, and production-grade cloud service clients.

**Overall Goal:** We are building the servicemanager package using a Test-Driven Development approach. We have already written the unit tests that define the required behavior of the StorageManager. Your task is now to write the implementation code that satisfies those tests.

**Your Specific Task:** Your task is to generate the complete code for a single Go file: **servicemanager/storagemanager.go**. This file will contain the StorageManager struct and its methods. The logic you write must be correct according to the provided test specification.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Pass All Tests:** This is the most critical requirement. Your generated code must correctly implement all the logic necessary to make the tests in the provided storagemanager\_test.go file pass. This includes:
    * **Idempotent Creation:** In CreateResources, you must first check if a bucket exists using the client. If it does, call Update. If it doesn't, call Create.
    * **Concurrency:** Use a sync.WaitGroup and goroutines to process all bucket configurations concurrently. Ensure that you safely collect any errors from the goroutines.
    * **Teardown Protection:** In Teardown, check the TeardownProtection flag before attempting to delete a bucket.
    * **Verification:** The Verify method must correctly check for the existence of all specified buckets.

**Dependencies (Full source code to be provided):**

1. **The Contract:** servicemanager/storageadapter.go (contains the StorageClient interface that the manager must use)
2. **The Specification:** servicemanager/storagemanager\_test.go (the unit tests your code must pass)
3. **The Schema:** servicemanager/systemarchitecture.go (contains the GCSBucket struct)

Output Instructions:  
Generate the complete, well-commented Go code for the storagemanager.go file.

* The package name must be servicemanager.
* The StorageManager struct should hold a StorageClient, a logger, and an environment config.
* The implementation must be thread-safe, especially when collecting errors from the concurrent operations.
* Provide clear logging for each major operation.
