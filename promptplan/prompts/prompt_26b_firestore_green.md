# **Prompt 27: Implementation for Firestore Adapter**

**Objective:** Generate the complete implementation for the googlefirestore.go adapter. The generated code must satisfy the previously defined integration tests.

**TDD Phase:** Green (Write the code to make the failing tests pass).

## **Primary Prompt (Concise)**

Your task is to generate the Go code for the servicemanager/googlefirestore.go file.

I have provided the DocumentStoreClient interface that the adapter must implement, and a complete integration test file (firestoremanager\_integration\_test.go). Your implementation of the Firestore adapter **must** make all the tests in the provided test file pass.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Use Admin Client:** The implementation **must** use the Firestore Admin client (cloud.google.com/go/firestore/apiv1/admin) for management operations like checking existence and creating the database.
* **Pass All Tests:** The generated code must successfully pass the lifecycle test defined in the integration test file, which includes handling the emulator's limitations.

## **Reinforcement Prompt (Detailed Context)**

**Persona:** You are an expert Go developer specializing in writing robust, production-grade clients for Google Cloud Platform services, with a deep understanding of the different client libraries available.

**Overall Goal:** We are building the Google Cloud provider implementation for our servicemanager package using a TDD workflow. We have already written the integration tests that define the required behavior of our Firestore adapter. Your task is now to write the implementation code that satisfies those tests.

**Your Specific Task:** Your task is to generate the complete code for a single Go file: **servicemanager/googlefirestore.go**. This file will contain the concrete gcpFirestoreClientAdapter struct and its methods, which implement the DocumentStoreClient interface.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Pass All Tests:** This is the most critical requirement. Your generated code must correctly implement all the logic necessary to make the tests in the provided firestoremanager\_integration\_test.go file pass.
* **Use Correct Client:** You **must** use the cloud.google.com/go/firestore/apiv1/admin client for all database management operations. This is distinct from the data-plane client (cloud.google.com/go/firestore).
    * The Exists method should be implemented by calling the admin client's GetDatabase method.
    * The Create method should be implemented by calling the admin client's CreateDatabase method, which is a long-running operation that you must wait on.
* **Adapter Pattern:** You must create the gcpFirestoreClientAdapter and gcpDatabaseHandleAdapter structs to wrap the real Google Cloud Firestore Admin client and satisfy our generic interfaces.

### **Implementation Guidelines & Constraints**

* **Use Modern, Idiomatic GCP Libraries:** You **must** use the most recent, idiomatic Google Cloud libraries.
* **Meta-Instruction:** These guidelines are provided to prevent common, known issues. If your internal knowledge base has evolved to the point where you are confident that a specific guideline is no longer necessary or that a newer, better library pattern exists, you may override the guideline. If you do so, you **must** leave a code comment explaining your reasoning.

**Dependencies (Full source code to be provided):**

1. **The Contract:** servicemanager/documentstore\_adapter.go (contains the DocumentStoreClient interface that the adapter must implement)
2. **The Specification:** servicemanager/firestoremanager\_integration\_test.go (the integration tests your code must pass)

Output Instructions:  
Generate the complete, well-commented Go code for the googlefirestore.go file.

* The package name must be servicemanager.
* Include a factory function CreateGoogleFirestoreClient that initializes the real Firestore Admin client and returns it wrapped in our generic DocumentStoreClient interface.
* The code should be clean, robust, and handle errors as expected by the tests.
