# **Prompt 21: Implementation for GCS Adapter**

**Objective:** Generate the complete implementation for the googlegcs.go adapter. The generated code must satisfy the previously defined integration tests.

**TDD Phase:** Green (Write the code to make the failing tests pass).

## **Primary Prompt (Concise)**

Your task is to generate the Go code for the servicemanager/googlegcs.go file.

I have provided the StorageClient interface that the adapter must implement, and a complete integration test file (googlegcs\_integration\_test.go). Your implementation of the GCS adapter **must** make all the tests in the provided test file pass.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Full Implementation:** The adapter must correctly implement all methods on the StorageClient interface using the cloud.google.com/go/storage SDK.
* **Type Conversion:** You must implement the logic to convert between our generic BucketAttributes struct and the Google-specific storage.BucketAttrs struct.
* **Pass All Tests:** The generated code must successfully pass the lifecycle test (Create, Update, Delete) defined in the integration test file.

## **Reinforcement Prompt (Detailed Context)**

**Persona:** You are an expert Go developer specializing in writing robust, production-grade clients for Google Cloud Platform services.

**Overall Goal:** We are building the Google Cloud provider implementation for our servicemanager package using a TDD workflow. We have already written the integration tests that define the required behavior of our GCS adapter. Your task is now to write the implementation code that satisfies those tests.

**Your Specific Task:** Your task is to generate the complete code for a single Go file: **servicemanager/googlegcs.go**. This file will contain the concrete gcsClientAdapter struct and its methods, which implement the StorageClient interface.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Pass All Tests:** This is the most critical requirement. Your generated code must correctly implement all the logic necessary to make the tests in the provided googlegcs\_integration\_test.go file pass. This includes:
    * Correctly calling bucket.Create() for new buckets.
    * Correctly calling bucket.Update() for existing buckets.
    * Correctly calling bucket.Delete() for teardown.
    * Correctly fetching attributes with bucket.Attrs().
* **Adapter Pattern:** You must create unexported adapter structs that wrap the real Google Cloud SDK types (e.g., realGCSBucketHandle wrapping \*storage.BucketHandle) to satisfy our internal, testable gcsBucketHandle interface. This is a crucial detail from the original code that enables unit testing.
* **Conversion Logic:** Implement the toGCSBucketAttrs and fromGCSBucketAttrs conversion functions accurately.

### **Implementation Guidelines & Constraints**

* **Use Modern, Idiomatic GCP Libraries:** You **must** use the most recent, idiomatic cloud.google.com/go/storage library.
* **Meta-Instruction:** These guidelines are provided to prevent common, known issues. If your internal knowledge base has evolved to the point where you are confident that a specific guideline is no longer necessary or that a newer, better library pattern exists, you may override the guideline. If you do so, you **must** leave a code comment explaining your reasoning.

**Dependencies (Full source code to be provided):**

1. **The Contract:** servicemanager/storageadapter.go (contains the StorageClient interface that the adapter must implement)
2. **The Specification:** servicemanager/googlegcs\_integration\_test.go (the integration tests your code must pass)

Output Instructions:  
Generate the complete, well-commented Go code for the googlegcs.go file.

* The package name must be servicemanager.
* Include a factory function CreateGoogleGCSClient that initializes the real \*storage.Client and returns it wrapped in our generic StorageClient interface.
* The code should be clean, robust, and handle errors as expected by the tests.
