# **Prompt 25: Implementation for BigQuery Adapter**

**Objective:** Generate the complete implementation for the BigQuery adapter. The generated code must satisfy the previously defined integration tests.

**TDD Phase:** Green (Write the code to make the failing tests pass).

## **Primary Prompt (Concise)**

Your task is to generate the Go code for the servicemanager/bigquery.go file, specifically the adapter implementation part.

I have provided the BQClient interface that the adapter must implement, and a complete integration test file (bigquery\_integration\_test.go). Your implementation of the BigQuery adapter **must** make all the tests in the provided test file pass.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Full Implementation:** The adapter must correctly implement all methods on the BQClient, BQDataset, and BQTable interfaces using the cloud.google.com/go/bigquery SDK.
* **Configuration Logic:** The implementation must correctly translate our generic BigQueryTable configuration (including time partitioning and clustering) into the specific bigquery.TableMetadata struct used by the SDK.
* **Pass All Tests:** The generated code must successfully pass the lifecycle test (Create Dataset, Create Table, Delete Dataset) defined in the integration test file.

## **Reinforcement Prompt (Detailed Context)**

**Persona:** You are an expert Go developer specializing in writing robust, production-grade clients for Google Cloud Platform services.

**Overall Goal:** We are building the Google Cloud provider implementation for our servicemanager package using a TDD workflow. We have already written the integration tests that define the required behavior of our BigQuery adapter. Your task is now to write the implementation code that satisfies those tests.

**Your Specific Task:** Your task is to generate the complete code for the adapter portion of the **servicemanager/bigquery.go** file. This will contain the concrete bqClientAdapter, bqDatasetClientAdapter, and bqTableClientAdapter structs and their methods.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Pass All Tests:** This is the most critical requirement. Your generated code must correctly implement all the logic necessary to make the tests in the provided bigquery\_integration\_test.go file pass.
* **Adapter Pattern:** You must create the adapter structs that wrap the real Google Cloud SDK types (\*bigquery.Client, \*bigquery.Dataset, \*bigquery.Table) to satisfy our generic interfaces.
* **Schema Inference:** The Create method for a table must correctly look up the registered schema struct, use bigquery.InferSchema to generate the schema, and include it in the TableMetadata.
* **Configuration Translation:** The table creation logic must accurately translate the TimePartitioningField, TimePartitioningType, and ClusteringFields from our generic config into the corresponding fields in the bigquery.TableMetadata struct.

### **Implementation Guidelines & Constraints**

* **Use Modern, Idiomatic GCP Libraries:** You **must** use the most recent, idiomatic cloud.google.com/go/bigquery library.
* **Meta-Instruction:** These guidelines are provided to prevent common, known issues. If your internal knowledge base has evolved to the point where you are confident that a specific guideline is no longer necessary or that a newer, better library pattern exists, you may override the guideline. If you do so, you **must** leave a code comment explaining your reasoning.

**Dependencies (Full source code to be provided):**

1. **The Contract:** servicemanager/bigquery.go (contains the BQClient interface that the adapter must implement)
2. **The Specification:** servicemanager/bigquery\_integration\_test.go (the integration tests your code must pass)

Output Instructions:  
Generate the complete, well-commented Go code for the adapter implementation in the bigquery.go file.

* The package name must be servicemanager.
* Include a factory function CreateGoogleBigQueryClient that initializes the real \*bigquery.Client and returns it wrapped in our generic BQClient interface.
* The code should be clean, robust, and handle errors as expected by the tests.
