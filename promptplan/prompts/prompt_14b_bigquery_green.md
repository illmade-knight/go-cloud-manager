# **Prompt 15: Implementation for BigQueryManager**

**Objective:** Generate the complete implementation for the BigQueryManager. The generated code must satisfy the previously defined unit tests.

**TDD Phase:** Green (Write the code to make the failing tests pass).

## **Primary Prompt (Concise)**

Your task is to generate the Go code for the servicemanager/bigquery.go file.

I have provided the BQClient interface that the manager must use, and a complete unit test file (bigquery\_test.go). Your implementation of the BigQueryManager **must** make all the tests in the provided test file pass.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Schema Validation:** The CreateResources method must call a Validate method first, which checks a global schema registry for all table SchemaTypes.
* **Dependency Handling:** The CreateResources method must create datasets first, then tables.
* **Idempotency (L2-1.3):** The CreateResources method must handle both the creation of new resources and the skipping of existing ones.
* **Concurrency (L2-1.4):** The implementation must process multiple datasets and tables in parallel using goroutines.

## **Reinforcement Prompt (Detailed Context)**

**Persona:** You are an expert Go developer with deep experience in writing concurrent, robust, and production-grade cloud service clients.

**Overall Goal:** We are building the servicemanager package using a Test-Driven Development approach. We have already written the unit tests that define the required behavior of the BigQueryManager. Your task is now to write the implementation code that satisfies those tests.

**Your Specific Task:** Your task is to generate the complete code for a single Go file: **servicemanager/bigquery.go**. This file will contain the BigQueryManager struct and its methods. The logic you write must be correct according to the provided test specification.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Pass All Tests:** This is the most critical requirement. Your generated code must correctly implement all the logic necessary to make the tests in the provided bigquery\_test.go file pass. This includes:
    * **Schema Registry:** The file must define a global, thread-safe map for registering schemas, along with a public RegisterSchema function.
    * **Validation Method:** Implement a Validate method that checks if all SchemaTypes in the BigQueryTable configs are present in the global registry.
    * **Two-Phase Creation:** The CreateResources method must first call Validate. Then, it must be implemented in two distinct, sequential phases: first, create all datasets concurrently; second, create all tables concurrently.
    * **Idempotent Creation:** For both datasets and tables, you must first check if the resource exists. If it does, skip creation.
    * **Teardown Logic:** The Teardown method should delete datasets using the DeleteWithContents method from the client interface.

**Dependencies (Full source code to be provided):**

1. **The Contract:** servicemanager/bigquery.go (contains the BQClient interface that the manager must use)
2. **The Specification:** servicemanager/bigquery\_test.go (the unit tests your code must pass)
3. **The Schema:** servicemanager/systemarchitecture.go (contains the BigQueryDataset and BigQueryTable structs)

Output Instructions:  
Generate the complete, well-commented Go code for the bigquery.go file.

* The package name must be servicemanager.
* The BigQueryManager struct should hold a BQClient, a logger, and an environment config.
* The implementation must be thread-safe, especially the global schema registry and the collection of errors from concurrent operations.
* Provide clear logging for each major operation.
