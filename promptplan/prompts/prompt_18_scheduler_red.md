# **Prompt 18: Unit Tests for SchedulerManager**

**Objective:** Generate the complete unit test file for the CloudSchedulerManager. These tests will serve as the executable specification for the CloudSchedulerManager's implementation.

**TDD Phase:** Red (Generate failing tests before the code exists).

## **Primary Prompt (Concise)**

Your task is to generate the Go code for the servicemanager/schedulermanager\_test.go file.

Using the provided SchedulerClient interface, write a comprehensive suite of unit tests for a CloudSchedulerManager struct that does not yet exist. The tests **must** use mocks for the SchedulerClient interface to validate all logic in isolation.

**Key Requirements to Test:**

* **Validation:** The CreateResources test must verify that the manager calls the client's Validate method before attempting to create jobs.
* **Idempotency (L2-1.3):** The CreateResources test must cover creating a new job and skipping an existing one.
* **Lifecycle Protection (L2-2.1):** The Teardown test must verify that a protected job is not deleted.
* **Verification:** The tests must cover successful and failed verification scenarios.

## **Reinforcement Prompt (Detailed Context)**

**Persona:** You are an expert Go developer with deep experience in writing thorough unit tests using the testify suite (mock, require, assert).

**Overall Goal:** We are building the servicemanager package using a Test-Driven Development approach. We have already defined the SchedulerClient interface. Our next step is to write the tests that will define and validate the behavior of the CloudSchedulerManager.

**Your Specific Task:** Your task is to generate the complete code for a single Go file: **servicemanager/schedulermanager\_test.go**. This file will contain a full suite of unit tests for the CloudSchedulerManager.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Use Mocks:** You **must** use testify/mock to create a MockSchedulerClient that implements the SchedulerClient interface.
* **Test Coverage:** You **must** create test cases for the following scenarios:
    * CreateResources:
        * Success case where a new job is created.
        * Success case where the job already exists and creation is skipped.
        * Failure case where the client's Validate method returns an error, ensuring no jobs are created.
        * Failure case where the CreateJob call itself fails.
    * Teardown:
        * Success case where an unprotected job is deleted.
        * A case where a job with TeardownProtection enabled is correctly skipped.
    * Verify:
        * Success case where the job exists.
        * Failure case where the job does not exist.

**Dependencies (Full source code to be provided):**

1. servicemanager/scheduleradapter.go (contains the SchedulerClient interface to be mocked)
2. servicemanager/systemarchitecture.go (contains the CloudSchedulerJob struct)

Output Instructions:  
Generate the complete, well-commented Go code for the schedulermanager\_test.go file.

* The package name must be servicemanager\_test.
* Include all necessary imports.
* Create mock structs for MockSchedulerClient and MockSchedulerJob.
* Write clean, readable tests with clear "Arrange, Act, Assert" sections.
