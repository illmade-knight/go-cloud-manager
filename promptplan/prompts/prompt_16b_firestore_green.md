# **Prompt 17: Implementation for FirestoreManager**

**Objective:** Generate the complete implementation for the FirestoreManager. The generated code must satisfy the previously defined unit tests.

**TDD Phase:** Green (Write the code to make the failing tests pass).

## **Primary Prompt (Concise)**

Your task is to generate the Go code for the servicemanager/firestoremanager.go file.

I have provided the DocumentStoreClient interface that the manager must use, and a complete unit test file (firestoremanager\_test.go). Your implementation of the FirestoreManager **must** make all the tests in the provided test file pass.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Idempotency (L2-1.3):** The CreateResources method must handle both creating a new database and skipping an existing one.
* **Special Teardown Logic:** The Teardown method must be a no-op that logs a warning and does not attempt to delete the database.
* **Verification:** The Verify method must correctly check for the existence of the database.

## **Reinforcement Prompt (Detailed Context)**

**Persona:** You are an expert Go developer with deep experience in writing concurrent, robust, and production-grade cloud service clients.

**Overall Goal:** We are building the servicemanager package using a Test-Driven Development approach. We have already written the unit tests that define the required behavior of the FirestoreManager. Your task is now to write the implementation code that satisfies those tests.

**Your Specific Task:** Your task is to generate the complete code for a single Go file: **servicemanager/firestoremanager.go**. This file will contain the FirestoreManager struct and its methods. The logic you write must be correct according to the provided test specification.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Pass All Tests:** This is the most critical requirement. Your generated code must correctly implement all the logic necessary to make the tests in the provided firestoremanager\_test.go file pass. This includes:
    * **Idempotent Creation:** In CreateResources, you must first check if a database exists using the client. If it does, skip creation and log an informational message. If it does not, call Create.
    * **Protected Teardown:** The Teardown method **must not** call any delete methods on the client. It should simply log a warning message explaining that Firestore deletion must be done manually.
    * **Verification:** The Verify method must correctly check for the existence of all specified databases.
    * **Concurrency:** Although Firestore typically only allows one database per project, the implementation should still use a sync.WaitGroup and goroutines to handle the list of database configurations for consistency with other managers.

**Dependencies (Full source code to be provided):**

1. **The Contract:** servicemanager/documentstore\_adapter.go (contains the DocumentStoreClient interface that the manager must use)
2. **The Specification:** servicemanager/firestoremanager\_test.go (the unit tests your code must pass)
3. **The Schema:** servicemanager/systemarchitecture.go (contains the FirestoreDatabase struct)

Output Instructions:  
Generate the complete, well-commented Go code for the firestoremanager.go file.

* The package name must be servicemanager.
* The FirestoreManager struct should hold a DocumentStoreClient, a logger, and an environment config.
* The implementation must be thread-safe.
* Provide clear logging for each major operation.
