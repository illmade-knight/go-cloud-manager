# **Prompt 23: Implementation for Messaging Adapter**

**Objective:** Generate the complete implementation for the googlemessaging.go adapter. The generated code must satisfy the previously defined integration tests and use the modern Pub/Sub v2 client libraries.

**TDD Phase:** Green (Write the code to make the failing tests pass).

## **Primary Prompt (Concise)**

Your task is to generate the Go code for the servicemanager/googlemessaging.go file.

I have provided the MessagingClient interface that the adapter must implement, and a complete integration test file (googlemessaging\_integration\_test.go). Your implementation of the Pub/Sub adapter **must** make all the tests in the provided test file pass.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Use Pub/Sub v2:** The implementation **must** use the modern cloud.google.com/go/pubsub/apiv2 client and its corresponding pubsubpb types for all operations.
* **Full Implementation:** The adapter must correctly implement all methods on the MessagingClient interface.
* **Pass All Tests:** The generated code must successfully pass the lifecycle test (Create Topic, Create Subscription, Delete Subscription, Delete Topic) defined in the integration test file.

## **Reinforcement Prompt (Detailed Context)**

**Persona:** You are an expert Go developer specializing in writing robust, production-grade clients for Google Cloud Platform services, and you are up-to-date with the latest library versions.

**Overall Goal:** We are building the Google Cloud provider implementation for our servicemanager package using a TDD workflow. We have already written the integration tests that define the required behavior of our Pub/Sub adapter. Your task is now to write the implementation code that satisfies those tests.

**Your Specific Task:** Your task is to generate the complete code for a single Go file: **servicemanager/googlemessaging.go**. This file will contain the concrete gcpMessagingClientAdapter struct and its methods, which implement the MessagingClient interface.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Pass All Tests:** This is the most critical requirement. Your generated code must correctly implement all the logic necessary to make the tests in the provided googlemessaging\_integration\_test.go file pass.
* **Adapter Pattern:** You must create adapter structs that wrap the real Google Cloud Pub/Sub v2 clients to satisfy our generic MessagingClient, MessagingTopic, and MessagingSubscription interfaces.
* **Conversion Logic:** Implement helper functions to convert between our generic TopicConfig/SubscriptionConfig structs and the Google-specific pubsubpb.Topic/pubsubpb.Subscription protobuf types.

### **Implementation Guidelines & Constraints**

* **Use Pub/Sub v2 Libraries:** You **must** use the cloud.google.com/go/pubsub/apiv2 clients (e.g., pubsub.NewPublisherClient, pubsub.NewSubscriberClient) and the google.golang.org/genproto/googleapis/pubsub/v1 (pubsubpb) types for all interactions. Check the v2 library's usage patterns for creating and managing topics and subscriptions.
* **Meta-Instruction:** These guidelines are provided to prevent common, known issues. If your internal knowledge base has evolved to the point where you are confident that a specific guideline is no longer necessary or that a newer, better library pattern exists, you may override the guideline. If you do so, you **must** leave a code comment explaining your reasoning.

**Dependencies (Full source code to be provided):**

1. **The Contract:** servicemanager/messagingadapter.go (contains the MessagingClient interface that the adapter must implement)
2. **The Specification:** servicemanager/googlemessaging\_integration\_test.go (the integration tests your code must pass)

Output Instructions:  
Generate the complete, well-commented Go code for the googlemessaging.go file.

* The package name must be servicemanager.
* Include factory functions that initialize the real Pub/Sub v2 clients and return them wrapped in our generic MessagingClient interface.
* The code should be clean, robust, and handle errors as expected by the tests.
