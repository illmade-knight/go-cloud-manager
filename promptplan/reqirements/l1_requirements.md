# **L1: Business & Functional Requirements**

## **1\. Core Mission**

| ID | Requirement | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1.1** | **Declarative Architecture Definition** | The system **shall** allow a user to define a complete microservice architecture, including all applications and their required cloud infrastructure, within one or more human-readable configuration files. |
| **1.2** | **Automated Lifecycle Management** | The system **shall** provide automated, command-line-driven workflows to provision (setup), verify the status of, and decommission (teardown) the entire architecture defined in the configuration files. |
| **1.3** | **Automated Service Deployment** | The system **shall** automate the process of building a service's source code into a container image and deploying that image as a running application on the target cloud platform. |

## **2\. Key Features**

| ID | Feature | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **2.1** | **Infrastructure Provisioning** | The system **shall** manage the full lifecycle (creation, updating, deletion) of all cloud infrastructure resources specified in the configuration. |
| **2.2** | **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** | The system **shall** automatically plan and apply all necessary IAM policies and permissions required for the defined services to operate and communicate with each other and with their infrastructure dependencies. This includes the creation and management of service account identities. |
| **2.3** | **Application Build & Deploy** | The system **shall** provide a unified command to orchestrate the build and deployment of all services in the architecture. This includes packaging source code, triggering a container build, and deploying the resulting image. |
| **2.4** | **Environment Management** | The system **shall** support the definition of multiple, distinct deployment environments (e.g., development, staging, production). It **must** be possible to override configuration variables and apply different lifecycle policies (e.g., teardown protection) on a per-environment basis. |
| **2.5** | **Pre-flight & Validation** | The system **shall** perform pre-flight validation checks before execution. This **must** include validating the syntax of configuration files and verifying that all necessary cloud service APIs are enabled in the target project. |

## **3\. Future Capabilities (Forward-Looking Requirements)**

| ID | Capability | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **3.1** | **Drift Detection** | The system **shall** provide a mechanism to detect and generate a report on any configuration drift, defined as differences between the state declared in the configuration files and the actual state of resources in the cloud environment. |
| **3.2** | **Cost Estimation** | The system **should** provide a command that generates a non-binding cost estimate for the resources defined in the architecture, using the cloud provider's pricing APIs. |
| **3.3** | **Granular Teardown** | The system **should** support more granular teardown operations, allowing a user to target a single service or a specific resource for deletion, in addition to the full dataflow teardown. |
