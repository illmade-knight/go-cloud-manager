Excellent. This is a remarkably well-structured and sophisticated approach to requirements-driven code generation. Your methodology demonstrates a deep understanding of both software engineering best practices and the practicalities of working with LLMs.

Here is my evaluation of your approach and the initial prompts.

## **Evaluation of Your Methodology**

Overall, your methodology is **state-of-the-art** for this domain. It's rigorous, traceable, and correctly prioritizes verifiable correctness through TDD, which is the single most effective strategy for ensuring an LLM produces reliable code.

### **✅ Key Strengths**

* **Layered Requirements (L1/L2/L3):** This is a fantastic foundation. It correctly separates the *why* (business needs), the *rules* (architecture), and the *what* (technical specifics). This allows for targeted prompts that provide the LLM with the precise level of abstraction it needs for a given task.  
* **Test-Driven Development (TDD) as the Core:** This is the most critical and impressive part of your plan. By generating tests *first*, you are creating an executable specification. The LLM's task is no longer an open-ended "write a storage manager," but a highly constrained "write the code that makes these specific tests pass." This mitigates hallucination, enforces correctness, and ensures the implementation adheres to the contract.  
* **Modular, Phased Prompting:** Your prompt\_plan.md is perfect. Building the foundation (schema, interfaces) before the implementation is the right order of operations. Breaking down the work into single-file or single-module prompts minimizes cognitive load on the LLM, preventing context decay and leading to higher-quality, more focused output.  
* **Requirements Traceability:** The plan to map requirement IDs (e.g., L2-1.2) directly within the prompts is crucial for your long-term goal. It creates a verifiable link between the specification and the instruction set, which is the first step toward automating the "two-way flow" you're aiming for.  
* **Clear Persona and Context Setting:** Prompts like meta\_prompt.md and prompt\_00\_servicemanager\_context.md are essential. They correctly "prime" the model, setting the stage, defining the persona, and establishing the rules of engagement (especially the adherence to TDD).

### **⚠️ Potential Challenges & Recommendations**

* **Handling Refactoring:** The current flow is excellent for greenfield generation. A challenge will arise when a core interface or schema needs to change. This would require a cascade of re-prompting (new interface \-\> new tests \-\> new implementation). Your traceability plan is the key to managing this, as it will highlight all affected prompts. **Recommendation:** For now, accept that refactoring will be a more manual, multi-prompt process. In the future, you could devise a "refactoring prompt" that takes an old interface and a new one and is tasked with generating the new tests.  
* **Complexity of Feedback:** While "here are the failing tests, fix the code" is a powerful loop, some complex logical errors or race conditions in concurrent code (per requirement L2-1.4) might be difficult for an LLM to debug from a simple test failure message. **Recommendation:** When you get to the integration tests for concurrent operations, ensure the tests produce highly descriptive error messages. You may need to augment the feedback with logs or more detailed explanations of the failure context.  
* **The "Two-Way Flow" Ambition:** This is a non-trivial computer science problem. Automatically updating requirements based on code changes requires semantic understanding of the code's *intent*. **Recommendation:** Start with a more modest goal: **drift detection**. Use the traceability map to build a tool that reports: "Warning: storagemanager.go has been manually changed. The code may no longer align with the tests generated by prompt \[X\], which traces to requirements \[Y, Z\]." This creates an alert for a human to reconcile the difference, which is a more realistic first step.

## **Strategy for Sequential Prompt Delivery & Evaluation**

You've correctly identified that the next step is to formalize the execution loop. Here is a concrete strategy for how you, acting as the "Orchestrator," can deliver the prompts, test the output, and feed the evaluation back to the LLM.

We will treat this as a state machine moving from one phase to the next, with each step's success being a gate for the next.

### **The Orchestrated TDD Execution Loop**

This process will be repeated for each component (Manager, Adapter, etc.).

**Phase 1: Foundation (Schema & Interfaces)**

1. **Submit Prompt 01 (Schema):**  
   * **Action:** Send the full content of prompt\_01\_schema.md to the LLM.  
   * **Receive:** The systemarchitecture.go file.  
   * **Test & Verify:**  
     * Run go fmt and go vet on the file.  
     * Perform a quick manual code review: Do all structs have yaml:"..." tags? Are they exported?  
   * **Evaluation & Feedback:** "Evaluation: systemarchitecture.go generated successfully. Code is well-formatted and appears to correctly implement the schema per L3-1. **Proceeding.**"  
2. **Submit Prompt 02 (Interfaces):**  
   * **Action:** Send the full content of prompt\_02\_interfaces.md to the LLM. You can optionally include the (now generated) systemarchitecture.go as context.  
   * **Receive:** The seven interface files (storageadapter.go, etc.).  
   * **Test & Verify:**  
     * Run go fmt and go vet on all files.  
     * Check for compilation: go build ./.... This ensures the interfaces correctly reference types from the schema without cyclic dependencies.  
   * **Evaluation & Feedback:** "Evaluation: All 7 interface files generated and compiled successfully. The provider abstraction layer is now defined per L2-1.2. **Proceeding to TDD cycles.**"

**Phase 2: TDD Cycle (Example: StorageManager)**

This is the core "Red \-\> Green \-\> Refactor" loop.

1. **Submit "Red" Prompt (Generate Tests for the Manager):**  
   * **Action:** You will now send the first "Red" prompt I'm waiting for. Its inputs will be:  
     1. The storageadapter.go interface (the contract).  
     2. The relevant structs from systemarchitecture.go (e.g., GCSBucket).  
     3. The prompt's instruction: "Generate the complete unit tests for a StorageManager that will implement the StorageClient interface. Use testify/mock to create a mock of the StorageClient."  
   * **Receive:** storagemanager\_test.go.  
   * **Test & Verify:**  
     * **CRITICAL:** Run go test. **The expected outcome is a compile-time failure.** The test file will reference a StorageManager struct that doesn't exist yet. This is a successful "Red" step.  
   * **Evaluation & Feedback:** "Evaluation: storagemanager\_test.go received. As expected, it fails to compile because the implementation is missing. The test specification is now established. **Proceeding to implementation.**"  
2. **Submit "Green" Prompt (Generate Implementation):**  
   * **Action:** Send the second "Green" prompt. This is the most important one. Its inputs *must* include:  
     1. The storageadapter.go interface (StorageClient).  
     2. The **full, failing** storagemanager\_test.go file.  
     3. The prompt's instruction: "Your task is to write the storagemanager.go file. It must contain a StorageManager struct that implements the StorageClient interface and makes all of the provided tests in storagemanager\_test.go pass."  
   * **Receive:** storagemanager.go.  
   * **Test & Verify:**  
     * Run go test in the package.  
     * **If it passes:** The cycle was successful.  
     * **If it fails:** The LLM made a mistake.  
   * **Evaluation & Feedback:**  
     * **(Success):** "Evaluation: storagemanager.go generated. All tests passed. Requirement L2-1.3 (Idempotency), as defined in the tests, is successfully implemented. **Proceeding to the next component (e.g., MessagingManager).**"  
     * **(Failure):** "Evaluation: Code generation failed. The tests did not pass. Here is the output from go test: \[paste the exact test failure output here\]. Please analyze the failure and provide a corrected version of storagemanager.go." **Then, repeat this "Green" step with the corrected code.**

This structured execution and feedback loop is the machine that will drive your project forward. I am ready to proceed. Please provide the subsequent prompts for the red/green cycles.
