## **Evaluation of Red/Green Prompts**

These prompts are of **very high quality**. They maintain the rigorous, structured, and traceable methodology we established.

### **✅ Key Strengths**

* **Consistency:** Each Red/Green pair is perfectly symmetrical. The "Red" prompt defines a clear specification by asking for tests against an interface, and the "Green" prompt provides the exact inputs (the interface and the tests) needed to generate the implementation. This consistency is ideal for an automated or semi-automated workflow.  
* **Traceability:** The prompts correctly and consistently reference the L-level requirements (e.g., L2-1.3 Idempotency, L2-2.1 Lifecycle Protection). This maintains the crucial link between the code's behavior and the documented requirements.  
* **Specificity:** The prompts are not vague. They give concrete instructions that directly map to the logic that needs to be implemented. For example:  
  * prompt\_12b\_messaging\_green.md explicitly calls out the two-phase creation/teardown (topics then subscriptions).  
  * prompt\_14\_bigquery\_red.md requires testing the schema validation against a registry, which is a key business rule for that manager.  
  * prompt\_16\_firestore\_red.md correctly specifies that the Teardown test must verify that a delete method is **not** called, which is a critical piece of special-case logic.  
* **Focus on Mocks:** The "Red" prompts all correctly insist on using testify/mock. This enforces the "unit testability" (L3-1) requirement and ensures the generated managers are decoupled from the adapters.

There are no significant weaknesses in these prompts. They are well-designed to produce the desired output.

## **Workflow Strategy: Red/Green First, Refactor Later**

Your gut feeling is **absolutely correct**. For an LLM-driven generation process, the approach of completing all Red/Green cycles before a dedicated refactoring phase is not just a good idea, it is the **recommended strategy**.

Here’s why you should confidently proceed with this approach:

### **1\. It Maximizes LLM Focus and Minimizes Context Drift**

An LLM maintains a limited context window. By batching similar tasks, you keep the LLM focused.

* **Generation Phase:** In this phase, the LLM's "state of mind" is purely creative and implementation-focused. Its entire context is about "satisfy these tests" and "implement this interface."  
* **Refactoring Phase:** This is a completely different cognitive task. It requires analytical and holistic reasoning about the entire codebase, focusing on concepts like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), abstraction, and code elegance.

Switching between these two modes for each component would be inefficient and greatly increase the risk of the LLM losing context or misapplying instructions.

### **2\. It Avoids "Doom Loops" on Unstable Code**

Your concern about "doom loops" is valid. Trying to refactor code that is still being generated is a recipe for instability. If you ask an LLM to refactor StorageManager and MessagingManager to use a shared utility function *before* BigQueryManager is even written, any lessons learned or patterns established during the refactor won't be applied to BigQueryManager. You would then have to do another refactoring pass, leading to wasted effort and potential inconsistencies.

### **3\. It Creates a Stable, Test-Covered Baseline**

By completing the full Red-Green loop for all managers first, you will have a **complete, functional, and fully unit-tested package**. This is an incredibly valuable asset. It represents a "known good" state. Refactoring from a position of 100% passing unit tests is safe and effective, as the tests act as a regression safety net.

### **Proposed Workflow Moving Forward**

I endorse your plan. Here is a formalization of it:

1. **Execute Red-\>Green Cycles (Current Phase):** Continue with your plan. Run the Red prompt, get the failing test. Run the Green prompt, get the passing implementation. Do this for *all* managers (Storage, Messaging, BigQuery, Firestore, Scheduler).  
2. **Execute Integration Red-\>Green Cycles:** After the managers are done, proceed with the prompts for the Google-specific adapters. These will follow the same TDD pattern, but the tests will be integration tests that likely use emulators or real APIs, rather than mocks.  
3. **Holistic Evaluation & Refactor (Future Phase):** Once the entire servicemanager package and its concrete adapters are generated and test-covered, initiate a new, distinct phase. This phase would involve prompts like:  
   * **Code Review Prompt:** "You are a senior Go architect. I have provided the source code for a complete servicemanager package. Please review it and identify all opportunities for refactoring to improve code quality, reduce duplication, and enhance maintainability."  
   * **Targeted Refactoring Prompt:** "Based on the review, a shared pattern for concurrent error handling was identified. Please write a new utility function and then refactor storagemanager.go and messagingmanager.go to use it. The existing unit tests must continue to pass."

This approach is methodical, safe, and plays to the strengths of the LLM. You are building a solid foundation first, then polishing it.

I am ready for the integration test prompts for the Google adapters when you are.
