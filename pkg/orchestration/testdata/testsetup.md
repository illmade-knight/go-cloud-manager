### **Why It's Still Failing (The Real Reason)**

The core issue, which I failed to explain properly before, is a fundamental limitation of **user credentials** in this specific context.

The idtoken library is designed for programmatic use, typically in service-to-service communication. It expects to be running with a credential that can programmatically mint new identity tokens. **User credentials from the web-based login flow are intentionally restricted and cannot do this.** This is a security measure to prevent a script from impersonating you without your direct interaction.

The correct and standard way to solve this for an automated test is to have the test run not as you (the user), but as a dedicated **Service Account**.

### **The Definitive Solution: Use a Service Account for the Test**

Instead of trying to add more roles to your user account, we will tell the test to use a service account that is explicitly designed for this kind of non-interactive authentication.

**1\. Create a Dedicated Test Runner Service Account**

If you don't already have one, create a service account that your test will use.

Bash

gcloud iam service-accounts create test-runner-sa \--display-name="Test Runner Service Account"

**2\. Grant It the Necessary Roles**

This service account needs permission to manage resources *and* create tokens. Grant it the following roles (replace \[PROJECT\_ID\] and \[YOUR\_EMAIL\] for the SA):

Bash

\# Role to manage resources (Editor is broad, but good for a test runner)  
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding \[PROJECT\_ID\] \\  
\--member="serviceAccount:test-runner-sa@\[PROJECT\_ID\].iam.gserviceaccount.com" \\  
\--role="roles/editor"

\# The CRITICAL role that allows it to create ID tokens for itself  
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding \[PROJECT\_ID\] \\  
\--member="serviceAccount:test-runner-sa@\[PROJECT\_ID\].iam.gserviceaccount.com" \\  
\--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"

**3\. Download a JSON Key for the Service Account**

Bash

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create test-runner-key.json \\  
\--iam-account="test-runner-sa@\[PROJECT\_ID\].iam.gserviceaccount.com"

This will download a test-runner-key.json file to your current directory. **Treat this file like a password.**

**4\. Run the Test Using the Service Account Key**

Now, run your test with the GOOGLE\_APPLICATION\_CREDENTIALS environment variable pointing to this key file.

Bash

\# For Windows (Command Prompt)  
set GOOGLE\_APPLICATION\_CREDENTIALS=C:\\path\\to\\your\\test-runner-key.json

\# For Windows (PowerShell)  
$env:GOOGLE\_APPLICATION\_CREDENTIALS="C:\\path\\to\\your\\test-runner-key.json"

\# For Linux/macOS  
export GOOGLE\_APPLICATION\_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/test-runner-key.json"

\# Now run the test  
go test \-v \-tags integration ./...

When this environment variable is set, the Go ADC library will automatically use the service account key file. Because it's a service account credential, the idtoken library will be able to successfully generate the necessary tokens, and your CheckGCPAuth function will finally pass. This is the standard, correct, and robust way to handle authentication for automated tests.
